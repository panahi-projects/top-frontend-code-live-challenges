# Top Front-end Code Live Challenges

Code-live interviews for front-end developers often involve real-time problem-solving to assess candidates' coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with front-end technologies. Here are 20 challenging tasks that could be used in such interviews:

1. [Build a responsive navigation menu that adapts to various screen sizes.](https://github.com/panahi-projects/top-frontend-code-live-challenges/tree/main/challenge-1)
2. [Input search by debounce function.](https://github.com/panahi-projects/top-frontend-code-live-challenges/tree/main/challenge-2)
3. [Create a masonary image grid with pure CSS and/or Javascript.](https://github.com/panahi-projects/top-frontend-code-live-challenges/tree/main/challenge-3)
4. Create a dynamic form with validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. Implement a lazy-loading mechanism for images on a webpage.

10. Implement client-side routing in a SPA without using external libraries.
11. Optimize the performance of a webpage by reducing load times and improving rendering.
12. Develop a custom modal/pop-up component with animations.

These challenges cover a range of front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, responsive design, and familiarity with popular front-end frameworks. Interviewers may adapt these challenges based on the specific technologies or frameworks relevant to the role they are hiring for. Candidates are often evaluated not only on the correctness of their solutions but also on the clarity, efficiency, and maintainability of their code.
