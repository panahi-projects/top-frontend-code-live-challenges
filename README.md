# Top Front-end Code Live Challenges

Code-live interviews for front-end developers often involve real-time problem-solving to assess candidates' coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with front-end technologies. Here are 20 challenging tasks that could be used in such interviews:

1. Build a responsive navigation menu that adapts to various screen sizes.
2. Create a dynamic form with validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Implement a lazy-loading mechanism for images on a webpage.
4. Build a carousel/slider component from scratch.
5. Develop a drag-and-drop interface for reordering elements on a page.
6. Create an autocomplete feature for a search input using AJAX.
7. Build a single-page application (SPA) using a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue).
8. Implement client-side routing in a SPA without using external libraries.
9. Optimize the performance of a webpage by reducing load times and improving rendering.
10. Develop a custom modal/pop-up component with animations.
11. Build a real-time chat application using WebSockets.
12. Create a responsive CSS grid layout without using frameworks like Bootstrap.
13. Implement infinite scrolling for a list of dynamic content.
14. Develop a complex UI component, such as a date picker or a range slider.
15. Build a feature that allows users to customize the theme or appearance of a website.
16. Optimize a webpage for accessibility, considering screen readers and keyboard navigation.
17. Implement a state management solution in a front-end framework (e.g., Redux in React).
18. Create a CSS animation or transition for a specific user interaction.
19. Build a dynamic chart or graph using a library like D3.js or Chart.js.
20. Integrate a third-party API into a front-end application and display the data.

These challenges cover a range of front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, responsive design, and familiarity with popular front-end frameworks. Interviewers may adapt these challenges based on the specific technologies or frameworks relevant to the role they are hiring for. Candidates are often evaluated not only on the correctness of their solutions but also on the clarity, efficiency, and maintainability of their code.
